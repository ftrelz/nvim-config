Do I need these?

LazyVim / lua / lazyvim / plugins / coding:
- mini.ai (Better text objects)

LazyVim / lua / lazyvim / plugins / editor:
- trouble (Better diagnostics window)

LazyVim / lua / lazyvim / plugins / formatting:
- Conform might be nice to have but LazyVim is doing some weirdness on
installing it. Maybe one day when I feel like working through what they're
doing I'll set it up.

LazyVim / lua / lazyvim / plugins / linting:
- nvim-lint seems superfluous but maybe one day I'll realize I need it.
